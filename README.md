# chatbot
This chatbot project is a simple web app that lets users chat with an AI bot. It uses a modern, responsive HTML/CSS interface and JavaScript to send messages to a Python backend (Flask). The backend processes user input and returns AI-generated replies, creating a real-time chat experience in your browser.
